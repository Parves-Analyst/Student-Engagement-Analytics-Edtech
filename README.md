## 📌 Overview

Student engagement is a key metric in evaluating the effectiveness of online learning platforms. This project explores over 640,000 records of user interaction from a real-world EdTech dataset, analyzing behavioral patterns such as course views, activity days, certifications, and video playbacks.

It delivers actionable insights for product teams to enhance platform usage, identify disengaged learners, and boost certification rates.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze engagement trends by registration status
* Identify patterns between activity levels and certification
* Explore video consumption and content completion rates
* Build a professional Power BI dashboard for stakeholders
* Derive insights for product improvements and learner retention

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

* **Python** – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **SQL (PostgreSQL)** – Analytical queries for pattern discovery
* **Power BI** – Executive-level dashboard creation
* **Jupyter Notebook** – EDA and preprocessing

---

## 💡 Key Insights

* Registered users have significantly higher engagement in events and learning days
* Certification rate remains low despite high activity from many users
* High video play doesn’t always correlate with certification
* Many users showed prolonged engagement duration but didn’t earn certificates
* Power users can be targeted for nudges to boost conversion rates
